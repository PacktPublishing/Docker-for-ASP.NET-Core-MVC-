## About the Video Course
This course supplies in-depth content that puts the theory into practice. It will show you how to build your very first ASP.NET Core application by adding a database and linking containers. Youâ€™ll learn to interact with your Docker Image and debug it into a container using Visual Studio. Then weâ€™ll show you how to run Docker images inside the cloud, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Then youâ€™ll see how to use Kubernetes from Google to deploy, scale, and manage containers, which is fast becoming the de facto for running containers in the cloud.
